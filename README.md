This repository shows that the Django tutorial https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/ has been completed step by step.

Throughout this tutorial, we have created a basic poll Django application that consists of two parts:
- A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
- An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.
