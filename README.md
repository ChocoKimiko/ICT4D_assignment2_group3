# ICT4D assignment 2 midterm: Django setup - group 3

This repository consists of two applications, namely mysite and seeds_advertisement.

**mysite** shows that the Django tutorial https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/ has been completed step by step.

Throughout this tutorial, we have created a basic poll Django application that consists of two parts:
- A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
- An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

**seeds_advertisement** shows an original application with a new data model, template and view. The topic is based on our use case 'AgroMarket Mobile'. This assignment was very informative, as we could gain some experience in developing with Django.
